                      Job Rebuilder’s main goal is to make business partnerships safe and secure. We’ll make that happen with our strong partnership system that starts by drafting a detailed partnership agreement, followed by documenting all contributions made by partners with the estimated cost for each contribution. We plan to operate as mediators among partners in the near future. We will introduce a fund raising section for our founders in our platform, and allowing people to invest in early-stage startups. Our vision is to connect more people to build businesses starting from California to the rest of the world. One of our further goals is to expand our operations and provide founders with affordable working spaces as we know the struggle of every founder who’s starting from zero.
